# HW3

## Collaborative Work Distribution:
For this homework I worked on the data wrangling and data presentation for assignment 2 with Xinran Yu (xy1002), Christian Rosado (cor2015) and Tyler Woebkenberg (tw1574). I feel that all four of us were able to contribute to this task. For the hypothesis formation phase of assignment 2, those previously mentioned along with Dana Karwas (dlk253) and Bailey Griswold (bg1672) helped with the brainstorming before splitting off to work on their own hypothesis. 

For assignments 1 & 3 I worked on my own using the skeleton notebooks provided in the PUI directory, although it was during the meeting with the above mentioned classmates that I was advised to use these as reference.

## Assignment Overview:

In assignment 1 I completed a jupyter notebook illustrating the Central Limit Theorem by generating samples of different sizes from various distributions all with the same mean and showing that the means of these samples are approximately normally distributed around the mean that they mutually share, with a variance that decreases towards 0 as the number of these samples increases.

In assignment 2 we came up with a hypothesis that older individuals tend to bike shorter distances when using citibikes. We then stated it as an appropriate null / alternative hypothesis, chose a signficance level and chose the data for February 2015 on the citibike website to test it. We then loaded the data and removed all unnecessary columns to extract only the information we needed (trip duration and rider age), and looked at their various distributions to better understand the data before applying a test of means.

In assignment 3 I tested the hypothesis that the mean of the bus times sampled in times.txt is lower than the old mean time of 36. I loaded the data in times.txt, converted it to a list, found its mean and standard deviation and used that to determine a z-statistic. As the z-value was above 2 in, we rejected the stated null hypothesis.
