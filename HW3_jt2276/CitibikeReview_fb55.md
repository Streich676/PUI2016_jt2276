You need to download the data within the notebook, with the curl command, wget or whichever way you prefer, and then move it to PUIDATA

You can have checks that sy "just read it from PUIDATA' if it is already there, but if it is not it should be downloaded on the fly.

The extreacted file should be left in PUiDATA, not in the local directory!

Figures: those histograms are not stacked. stacked is when you put them one on top of the other along the y axis, not one on top of the other on the plane of the image

the data is propely manipulated and it supports a test of means (e.g. t-test)
