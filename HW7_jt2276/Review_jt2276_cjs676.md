### Clarity
1. Positive: I understand what you are trying to show me just by looking at the graph.
2. Positive: The caption under the graph is informative and well written. 
3. Positive: Overall the graph is nicely sized and the elements (axis labels etc.) seem to fit.  
4. Negative. A title would be helpful.  




### Aesthetic
1. Positive: Googd labels.
2. Positive: Well placed legend.  
3. Negative: I think a title would help

### Honesty
Honestly conveys the information. 

### Conclusion
You had a difficult task showing an "increase in depth." Should the graph move up or down? I think you chose wisely showing the increase in depth in a positive manner (The graph goes up)
