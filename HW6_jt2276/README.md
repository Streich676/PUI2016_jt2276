For assignment 1 I worked with Dana, Bailey, Adrian, Keith Dumanski, and Celia. We ran through the skeleton notebook downloading the csv and shp files as dataframes and wrangling the data in both cases. Using pandas's to_numeric function we were able to put all data in either a numeric or NaN format, which allowed us to run regressions on the number of units in a building and its total energy consumption. We ran both cases of IV and DV pairs and compared the results, showing that total units makes for a better IV since it has less clustering of values. We then compared both a linear and quadratic fit for the data and compared the likelihood statistic for the models, and concluded that the simpler linear model is preferrable. I feel like all participants were able to contribute whenever we started to get stuck on a section in the code.

For assignment 2 we posted a summary of our results of the citibike investigation as an Authorea collaborative document, which can be found at: https://www.authorea.com/users/105835/articles/133675/_show_article
