This is a template for the table. To see how it is written clock on the Raw link to see this README.md in its raw unrendered format.

Note that for the case of the t-test, a significant number of t-test were performed throughout the cited paper to answer different questions. 
I have chosen one of them to fill out the table. Also note that the paper refers to p-values of 0.05 as significant, implying that alpha > 0.05.
