I worked alone for assignment 1 to review the notebook of Anastasiya Shegay (as10790). I had examined the repository of my other possible assignment,Yuan Shi (ys2808), and I had seen that he had already accepted the addition of a review file from another classmate. It was only after I submitted the pull request to Anastasiya Shegay's repository that I saw that there are pull requests related to this assignment from two other classmates.

I also worked alone for assignment 2 to outline the statistical tests used in recent PLOS One papers, their summary tables are as follows:

Note that for the case of the t-test, a significant number of t-test were performed throughout the cited paper to answer different questions. 
I have chosen one of them to fill out the table. Also note that the paper refers to p-values of 0.05 as significant, implying that alpha > 0.05.

I worked on assignments 3 & 4 with Xinran Yu (xy1002), Christian Rosado (cor2015), Dana Karwas (dlk253), Bailey Griswold (bg1672), Tyler Woebkenberg (tw1574) and Adrian Dahlin. We used Dana's computer hooked up to a projector so that we could collectively discuss the proper approach to take for each section of the provided notebooks.
